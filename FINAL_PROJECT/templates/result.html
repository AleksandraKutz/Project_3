        <!-- Summary of Findings -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">A brief summary of our analysis</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of pediatricians across California and examines the complex factors that influence access to pediatric healthcare. As the state continues to grow and evolve, ensuring that children, particularly those in underserved areas, have access to quality medical care is becoming an increasingly important challenge. The distribution of pediatricians is not uniform across regions, with certain areas facing significant shortages that affect the quality and timeliness of care available to children.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Result 1 -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">1. High Health Insurance Coverage</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">California boasts a 96.5% health insurance coverage rate for children, primarily due to programs like Medi-Cal, which provide low-income families with access to affordable healthcare.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Result 2 -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">2. Pediatrician Shortages</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">On average, there is one pediatrician for every 1,115 children in California. However, areas like Bakersfield face more severe shortages, primarily due to geographic isolation and a lack of medical professionals.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Result 3 -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">3. Limited Correlation with Population Density</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">On average, there is one pediatrician for every 1,115 children in California. However, in many areas, especially rural regions, the ratio can be much higher, with some places having one pediatrician for several thousand children, highlighting significant disparities in access to pediatric care.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Result 4 -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">4. Family Income and Pediatric Care</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">While there is a statistically significant relationship between family median income and the children-to-pediatrician ratio, it only explains 5.14% of the variability in pediatric care distribution. This indicates that family income has a relatively minor impact on access to pediatric care.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Result 5 -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">5. Poverty and Pediatric Care</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">Similarly, the poverty ratio has a statistically significant relationship with the children-to-pediatrician ratio, but it also accounts for only 5.14% of the variability, highlighting that poverty plays a limited role in shaping the pediatric care landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <div class="list-group-item analysis-item">
            <h5 class="analysis-title">Conclusion</h5>
            <p class="analysis-body">While socioeconomic factors such as family income and poverty levels are statistically significant, they explain only a small portion of the variability in the distribution of pediatric care. The analysis indicates that the relationship between family income, poverty, and the availability of pediatricians is weak, suggesting that these factors alone do not fully determine access to pediatric care. Instead, the distribution of pediatricians in California results from a combination of other, more complex factors. The findings emphasize the need for policies that not only address socioeconomic disparities but also focus on improving healthcare access and the equitable distribution of pediatricians across the state. To better address this issue, it would be important to investigate additional factors that could have a more significant impact on pediatrician availability, especially considering the overall shortage of healthcare providers in the state.</p>

    <!-- Why is this important? -->
    <div class="important-section">
        <h5 class="analysis-title">Why is this important?</h5>
        <p class="analysis-body">Comparing these factors can help identify areas with limited access to pediatric care and highlight the social factors (such as income, poverty, population density, and insurance coverage) that most affect children's health and access to healthcare. This allows for better planning of health policies and investments in pediatric care in regions that need it the most.</p>
