# Access to Pediatric Care in California: Analyzing the Socioeconomic Factors Behind Healthcare Deserts
## Project 3: Group 1. Data visualization track
## Amy Dos Santos, Chloe King, Aleksandra Kutz, Carmen Dual



### **Project Overview:** 
Are there any pediatric care deserts in California? Where are they, and what socioeconomic factors contribute to this phenomenon?
==WE NEED TO EXPAND ON THIS, INCLUDE SOME BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND THE PURPOSE==

### **Definitions:**
**-Pediatric care desert:** There are several ways this can be defined, for this analysis we are using the ratio of children per pediatrician of 1,200:1. We decided on this based on a review of several research papers reviewed.^1^

**-Number of Pediatricians:** Total number of clinicians and doctors with a current medical license, that report Pediatric Medicine as their primary area of practice.^3^

**-Children**: Total number of children between 0 and 18 years old.^2^

**-Family Income:** Total amount of money received by all family members 15 years old and over with income.^2^ 

**-Poverty Rate:** Percentage of total population with poverty status.^2^

**-Population Density:** Total population divided by the land area in square miles.^2^

**-Insurance coverage:** Percentage of the total population that was considered covered by health insurance at some time during the year.^2^

### **Hypothesis:**
**-Poverty Rate:** Zip codes with lower poverty levels will have less kids per doctor.

**-Family Median Income:** Zip codes with higher family median income will have less kids per doctor.

**-Population Density:** Higher density zip codes will have less kids per doctor.

**-Insurance coverage:**  Zip codes with higher insurance coverage will have less kids per doctor.

### **How to use and interact with the project:**

==WE NEED TO ADD THIS INFORMATION STILL==

## **Ethical Considerations**

We reviewed the Terms of Service for both the Census Bureau and the California Health and Human Services (CalHHS) to determine if and how we can use the datasets provided, and any requirements we should follow.

For the Census Bureau, we found that we are allowed to search, retrieve and display the data from their database through their API or downloading the tables as CSVs, and that we can attribute the data to the Census Bureau database, as long as we don't modify it or falsely represent the information obtained.^4^

For CalHHS,  we found that we had license to use the data, but have to atribute credit to the CalHHS and ensure we do not modify or misrepresent the dataset.^5^ 

==WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO ADD? I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING ABOUT DOCTORS PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE CalHHS dataset==
